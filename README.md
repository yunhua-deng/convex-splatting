This repo contains the official implementation for the paper "3D Convex Splatting: Radiance Field Rendering with 3D Smooth Convexes". 
Our work represents a significant advancement in radiance field rendering by introducing 3D smooth convex primitives, which offer an efficient, geometrically meaningful, and flexible approach to scene representation and synthesis.

## Cloning the Repository + Installation

The code has been used and tested with Python 3.11 and CUDA 12.6.

You should clone the repository with the different submodules by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/convexsplatting/convex-splatting --recursive
```

Then, we suggest to use a virtual environment to install the dependencies.

```bash
micromamba create -f requirements.yaml
```

Finally, you can compile the custom CUDA kernels by running the following command:

```bash
bash compile.sh
cd submodules/simple-knn
pip install .
```

## Training
To train our model, you can use the following command:
```bash
python train.py -s <path_to_scenes> -m <output_model_path>
```

If you want to train the model on outdoor scenes, you should add the following command:  
```bash
python train.py -s <path_to_scenes> -m <output_model_path> --outdoor
```

If you want to train our light model, you should add the following command:  
```bash
python train.py -s <path_to_scenes> -m <output_model_path> --light
```

## Rendering
To render a scene, you can use the following command:
```bash
python render.py -m <path_to_model>
```

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model, you can use the following command:
```bash
python metrics.py -m <path_to_model>
```

## Video
To render a video, you can use the following command:
```bash
python create_video.py -m <path_to_model>
```

## Replication of the results
To replicate the results of our paper, you can use the following command:
```bash
python full_eval.py --output_path <output_path> -m360 <path_to_MipNeRF360> -tat <path_to_T&T> -db <path_to_DB>
```
